### About
Simple set of files to automate hibernation at night.
To do this, create separate tasks @ "Control Panel > 
System and Security > Administrative Tools > Task Scheduler"
appropriately, i.e. ten_minute_reminder.vbs ten minutes 
before hibernate_computer.bat, and hibernate_computer.bat at 
the time you wish your computer to automatically hibernate
